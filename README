For the usage of the loader to binarize the image:
./loader <filename_image.png>

For the usage of the rotator of th binarized image:
./rotator <filename_image.png> <degrees_to_rotate>

For the usage of the neural network:
./neural_network

For the usage of the solver:
./solver <filename_of_the_grid> <word_to_search>


For the detector, this program only work
for the images of the level 1 and the level 2
after being correctly rotated, this is not working 
for the images of the level 3.
